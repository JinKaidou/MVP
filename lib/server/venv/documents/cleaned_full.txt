not approved by school officials s hall be considered absent. Incomplete

term pe riod, s/he shall be given the computed grade for the whole semester.
If a student fails to attend classes (after mid -terms) for the rest of the semester
but has a passing mid -term grade, final grade computation will simply factor
in all graded activities.  Therefore, D/F will not be based on absences, but on
performance/output.

regularly scheduled class time.
● Educational Tours  refer to off -campus learning activities involvi ng

on the part of the students, prior consultation with concerned students
shall be undertaken by the faculty.

1. Thank the guest for accepting the invitation through a letter to make it
formal and official. Include in the “Thank You” letter the provisions
that the organizers will provide.
2. Provision of transportation service, accommodation, meals, etc.
3. Ambassadors and top government officials like cabinet members

6. The organization’s faculty moderator must always be consulted

USTP Student Handbook 2021

your guest to arrive. It might be even h elpful to emphasize that the
participants shall be in the venue properly seated at least 15 minutes
before the program starts.
8. It is essential that the student assigned to introduce the important
guest to be accurate in presenting the guest’s bio -data. Not hing can be

while reading the bio -data. The one doing the introduction should
always be respectful, appropriate and proper  in addressing the guest.
9. The guest shall be offered a meal either before or after the activity or
as preferred by the guest. Booking for the use of conference room for
luncheon for VIP visitors shall be done in advance. The organizer shall
ensure close co ordination with the person in -charge.
10. The student assigned to usher the guest shall engage him/her in a
conversation during waiting moments or during meal, endeavor to
invite key university officials to be with the guest, and as much as
practicable, the officials to be invited are those whose office or
functions are related to the activity.
11. Make sure that the guest is escorted back to the vehicle at the end of
his/her engagement.
12. Send a formal ‘Thank You’ letter or note after the activity. This could
establish goodwill between your organization and your guest.
Art. 8. Intramurals, Sports and other Vigorous Activities

to the Activities Chairman for him/her to be allowed to participate in the

activities is a paramount responsibility and con cern of USTP. Although
USTP Student Handbook 2021
62
safety -related problems during said activities have so far been very
seldom, still it is incumbent upon the Activities Chairpersons and every
Activity Manager to be constantly alert, capable and well -prepared to
effectively respond t o any critical situation arising from such activities.
Section 4. Inspection of Activity Site and Facilities . In coordination with
the Auxiliary Services Director and the OSA Director the Activity/ies
Manager should spearhead the ocular inspection of the suitability of the

submission is accepted by the ob ject of said act.

segregating or classifying the employee which in any way
would discriminate, deprive or diminish employment
oppo rtunities or otherwise adversely affect said
employee/personnel;
ii. The above acts would impair the employees/personnel’s rights
or privileges under existing laws; or
USTP Student Handbook 2021
